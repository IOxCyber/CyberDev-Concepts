## [EDR vs Antivirus](https://cybriant.com/antivirus-vs-edr/):
- `EDR` (Endpoint Detection & Response) or [behavior-based](https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/wiki-section/products/behavior-based-protection)[^1] endpoint protection system.
- Antivirus programs are more `simplistic and limited in scope` & work upon their DB (detects malware and viruses by [signature-based](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-signature-based-detection)[^2] detection)
- EDR contains many security tools like Antivirus, firewalls, whitelisting tools, and monitoring tools.
- EDR agent on the endpoints constantly monitors for changes in behavior that could indicate the presence of malicious software.
- Examples:
1. CrowdStrike is a cloud-based antimalware solution that offers real-time protection, network traffic analysis, advanced threat intelligence, and fileless attack mitigation.
2. Bitfender offers a variety of features, including advanced heuristics, BIOS validation, and advanced memory scanning. 
3. Webroot is an antivirus solution that is available as both an on-premise and cloud-based solution.

## Other Systems:
1. `Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV)`: cybersecurity tool that leverages AI, ML & behavioral detection and exploit mitigation to anticipate and prevent both known and unknown threats.
2. Managed Detection and Response (MDR): Endpoint security â€œas a service", manages endpoint security technologies for organizations which includes EDR, guided response, managed remediation etc.
3. Extended Detection and Response (XDR): Extended Detection and Response (XDR) is a consolidation of tools and data that provides extended visibility, analysis, and response across endpoints, workloads, users, and networks.



































[^1]: If a program tries to search, modify or delete some important file then it will be considered as malicious 'actions' or behaviors that are typical of malware.
[^2]: In this style of detection, unique identifiers are generated about a known attack so that any attack of that kind is rapidly dealt with.
